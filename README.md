# spotify-development-sample-app
Uses the Spotify Android SDK (https://github.com/spotify/android-sdk) and the Web API (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
to retrieve user's last (1-50) most recently listened to tracks. The tracks requested are returned in a JSON format which is parsed using
Google GSON library. AnyChart Android library is used to sort that data into a pie chart.
